Admob

AdMob is an advertising service that enables mobile app developers to generate revenue. It should not be confused with AdSense and AdWords, which are the advertising services Google offers for websites. To put it more simply; AdMob allows you to earn money by adding ads to your mobile app. Originally founded by Omar Hamoui in 2006 and purchased by Google in November 2009 for $ 750 million AdMob is one of the most preferred revenue generating models in the Android world, bringing advertisers and developers together. AdMob offers revenue based on the rate of clicks on ads, rather than charging based on the number of downloads of apps. You can earn high earnings based on the popularity of your application, thanks to which users show ads according to the categories they are interested in.
